# Benchmarking uint32 set implementations

This is a set of uint32 set implementations that I created for benchmarking purposes.

## Problem

I had a problem that boiled down to 2 sub-problems:

* cardinality of set E, where E is the set of all values (i.e. the count-distinct problem)
* is x âˆˆ E ?

In the specific program, the `add` operation to the set took up the vast 
majority of the total CPU time, i.e. `adding` elements to the set as fast as 
possible is the #1 point for optimization. Also, counting had to be precise,
so probabilistic data structure like HyperLogLog and Bloom filters were out of 
the question.

## Benchmark Results

This was on my machine (Mid-2015 MacBook Pro):
